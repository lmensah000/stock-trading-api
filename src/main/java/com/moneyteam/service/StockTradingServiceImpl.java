/*
The stock trading class, let's call it StockTradingService, encapsulates the logic for executing stock or options
trades based on strategies, analysis, and risk management.
Here's an example of a stock trade execution method in the StockTradingService:
public void executeStockTrade(User user, Stock stock, StockStrategy strategy) {
    // Access the required data, such as user account details, from the UserService or other repositories
    // Perform the necessary analysis and calculations based on the provided stock and strategy
    // Interact with the stock trading API to execute the trade
    // Update user account balances, transaction history, etc.
}
Within this method, you can access the required user data, perform analysis using the provided stock and strategy,
interact with the stock trading API to execute the trade, and update the user's account information accordingly.
