The UserService handles user-related functionalities such as authentication, registration, and managing user-specific data.
Here are some examples of user-related functionalities:
Authentication: The authenticateUser method receives a username and password as input, verifies the credentials
against the stored user data, and returns the authenticated user object. Example: User authenticatedUser = userService.authenticateUser(username, password);
Registration: The registerUser method takes a User object as input, saves the user details to the database or
repository, and completes the user registration process. Example: userService.registerUser(newUser);
Managing User Data: The UserService can have methods to update user information, retrieve user-specific data,
or perform any other operations related to managing user data.

User Profile: Allow users to create and update their profiles, including personal information, contact details,
and preferences. This data can be stored in a user-specific database table or document.

Account Balances: Keep track of users' account balances, including available funds for trading, holdings,
and transaction history. This information can be stored in a user-specific account table or document.

Watchlists: Enable users to create and manage watchlists of stocks or options they are interested in.
Store the watchlist data associated with each user, allowing them to easily track their preferred securities.

Trade History: Maintain a record of users' past trades, including details such as trade type, date, time,
quantity, price, and any associated fees. This data can be stored in a user-specific trade history table or document.

Notifications: Implement a notification system to keep users informed about important events, such as trade
executions, account updates, or market alerts. Store the notification preferences and history for each user.

Preferences and Settings: Allow users to customize their app experience by providing options to set preferences
 and configure settings, such as language, theme, notification preferences, and default trading strategies.

Security and Authentication: Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure
access to user-specific data. Store user credentials securely and manage user sessions to maintain a secure environment.


These are just a few examples of managing user-specific data in your stock trading app. The specific functionalities
and data management requirements may vary based on your app's design and user needs.


Remember to handle user data responsibly, following applicable privacy regulations and best practices to protect
 user privacy and ensure data security.
